                        <p>The coronavirus has already spread to almost every country in the world. It has led to a substantial 
                            loss of human life worldwide.</p>
                        <p>The map gives a good overview on which countries are impacted the most by the virus. It can be seen 
                            based on the number of <span class="cases_text">cases</span> as well as 
                            <span class="deaths_text">deaths</span>, and each country is coloured based on different classes of <strong>severity</strong>.</p>
